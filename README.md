# MLimputation - Machine learning techniques for imputation


There is a number of different R packages for imputation, e.g. [VIM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=VIM), [simputation](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=simputation), [missForest](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=missForest) or  [mice](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mice). However, none of them make the wide range of readily avalaible machine learning techniques available exhaustively as the [caret](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=caret) package does for classification and regression techniques in genereral.

Our idea is to make an imputation *R* wrapper around *caret*.
